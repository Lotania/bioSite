			<p id="about-line">Bryant Nguyen had a unique birth; he was born on March 14, 1999, on a living room couch. Since then, he has lived a unique life. Though he has no recollection of his school days, he still keeps his important hobbies and ambitions close to him. He has a great talent in art and strives to be a comic artist/animator; although he was enamored by the stylistic animations of Don Bluth, he is creating his own style to leave his mark on the world. He is an avid gamer, having amassed a vast library, and a sightseer from the local cityscapes of the DFW metroplex, to the remote mountain villages and beautiful skylines of Vietnam.</p>
						<p id="about-line">He lives by his own code, choosing not to dwell on his past, and instead focusing on his future, one day at a time. He treasures each and every moment of his life; even the simple pleasures of waking up the next morning to see what lies ahead of him for the day, finishing a panel in a comic, making his own high-performance computer from seemingly simple components, or pulling off an insane stunt in Monster Hunter are not taken lightly. To him, that is proof he is alive. Although many things happened in his childhood, he holds no regrets for any of it. He lives for the future, and he has a plan to achieve his goals. He says he currently has no prospects of being in a relationship, but heâ€™s looking towards the future, so anything could happen.</p>
